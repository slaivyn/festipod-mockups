# Data-Layer Testing

BDD scenarios tagged `@data` test the real NextGraph data pipeline through a broker, not mocked data.

## Overview

`@data` scenarios run Cucumber steps against a real NextGraph broker. Playwright drives a Chromium instance that authenticates with the broker, which loads our test harness in an iframe. The harness uses real `useShape`/ORM subscriptions and exposes a `window.__testData` bridge for step definitions.

## Architecture

```
Cucumber steps → Playwright (Chromium, persistent profile)
                      ↓
               https://nextgraph.eu/auth/#/?o=http://127.0.0.1:{port}
                      ↓
               Broker wallet login (automated)
                      ↓
               Broker loads app in iframe → http://127.0.0.1:{port}
                      ↓
               harness-ng.tsx (init → useShape → ORM → broker)
                      ↓
               window.__testData bridge
```

## Dual Mode

- **Real broker** (default): `harness-ng.tsx` with NextGraph ORM through broker iframe
- **Mock fallback**: `harness.tsx` with standalone DeepSignalSets (if NG harness build fails)

## Wallet Lifecycle

Fully automated — no manual interaction required. CI-ready.

### First Run (wallet creation)
1. `BeforeAll` detects no `.wallet-ready` marker in `.playwright-profile/`
2. Launches headless Chromium with persistent profile
3. Navigates to `https://nextgraph.eu/` → clicks "Create Wallet"
4. Redirected to `account.nextgraph.eu` → clicks "I accept" (ToS)
5. Redirected back → fills username/password form → submits
6. Wallet created in localStorage → marker written
7. This is also a real test of the app's auth/login feature

### Subsequent Runs (automated login)
1. Marker found → skip wallet creation
2. Headless Chromium with persistent profile
3. Automated login: click "Login" → click wallet link → fill password → submit
4. Broker authenticates, loads app harness in iframe
5. Harness initializes NG, creates ORM subscriptions, seeds data if needed
6. `window.__testData.ready` → steps execute via `appFrame.evaluate()`

### Wallet Credentials
- Name: `festipod-tests`
- Password: `festipod-tests`

## Key Technical Details

### Chromium Flags
```
--disable-features=PrivateNetworkAccessRespectPreflightResults,BlockInsecurePrivateNetworkRequests,...
--allow-insecure-localhost
--disable-web-security
```
Required because broker at `nextgraph.eu` (public) loads harness from `http://127.0.0.1:{port}` (local) in an iframe — Chromium's Private Network Access blocks this by default.

### Persistent Profile (`.playwright-profile/`)
- Stores NG wallet in localStorage (`ng_wallets` on `nextgraph.eu`, `ng_bootstrap` on `nextgraph.net`)
- Gitignored
- Must use full Chrome binary, not `chrome-headless-shell`

### HTTP Server
- Started in `BeforeAll` on auto-assigned port (`127.0.0.1:0`)
- Serves harness HTML at `/` and JS bundle at `/harness.js` (separate files — inline script breaks due to special characters in bundle)
- Shut down in `AfterAll`

### ORM Subscriptions
Harness creates subscriptions for all three shapes with scope `did:ng:i` (private store):
- `FpEventShapeType` → events
- `FpUserProfileShapeType` → users
- `FpParticipationShapeType` → participations

### Test Bridge (`window.__testData`)
Exposed by the harness, consumed by steps via `appFrame.evaluate()`:
- `events`, `users`, `participations` — live DeepSignalSets
- `currentUserId` — IRI of the test user
- `getEvent(id)`, `getEventByTitle(title)` — lookups
- `joinEvent(eventId, userId)`, `leaveEvent(eventId, userId)` — mutations
- `isParticipating(eventId, userId)`, `getEventParticipants(eventId)` — queries
- `updateEvent(eventId, updates)` — field updates

## E2E Layer (`@e2e`)

`@e2e` scenarios test the real app UI running inside the broker iframe. Unlike `@data` which loads a test harness, `@e2e` loads the actual app.

### Architecture

```
Cucumber steps → Playwright (Chromium, persistent profile)
                      ↓
               https://nextgraph.net/redir/#/?o=http://127.0.0.1:{appPort}
                      ↓
               Broker wallet login (automated, same as @data)
                      ↓
               Broker loads REAL APP in iframe → http://127.0.0.1:{appPort}
                      ↓
               App renders with NextGraphProvider auto-connecting
                      ↓
               Steps interact via appFrame.evaluate() and Playwright locators
```

### App Server

Started in `BeforeAll` alongside the harness server:
1. Find a free port
2. `spawn('bun', ['src/index.ts'], { env: { PORT: appPort } })`
3. Poll until the server responds to HTTP GET
4. Killed in `AfterAll`

### Shared Infrastructure

`@e2e` reuses the same `setupBrokerPage()` helper as `@data` — handles broker redirect URL construction, wallet login automation, and iframe discovery.

### Step Definitions

E2E steps live in module directories (e.g., `src/modules/auth/steps/e2e/connexion.steps.ts`). They use:
- `this.appFrame!.evaluate()` — run JS in the app iframe (hash navigation, content checks)
- `this.appFrame!.locator()` — find and interact with DOM elements
- `this.appFrame!.waitForFunction()` — poll for expected state (screen content, URL changes)
- `SCREEN_MARKERS` — map screen IDs to unique text content for verification

### Before Hook (`@e2e`)

```
1. Open new Playwright page
2. setupBrokerPage(page, realAppUrl) → automated login → find app iframe
3. Wait for React render (root.innerHTML.length > 100)
4. Wait 3s for NG connection + provider stabilization
```

### Differences from `@data`

| Aspect | `@data` | `@e2e` |
|--------|---------|--------|
| What loads in iframe | Test harness (`harness-ng.tsx`) | Real app (`src/index.ts`) |
| Ready signal | `window.__testData.ready === true` | `root.innerHTML.length > 100` |
| Interaction | `evaluate()` on test bridge | `evaluate()` + Playwright locators |
| Mock fallback | Yes (standalone DeepSignalSets) | No — requires real broker |
| Tests | Data operations (CRUD, queries) | UI behavior (navigation, redirects, clicks) |

| `src/modules/event/steps/data/inscription.steps.ts` | Inscription data steps |
| `src/modules/auth/steps/e2e/connexion.steps.ts` | Auth/connection e2e steps |

| `scripts/debug-browser.ts` | Manual browser debug tool — launches headed Chromium to inspect broker interactions |
| `.playwright-profile-debug/` | Chromium profile created by debug-browser.ts (gitignored) |

## Commands

```bash
bun run test:data      # Run @data scenarios (real broker if wallet exists, mock fallback)
